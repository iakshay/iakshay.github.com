title: Hello World

It’s been a long wait, but finally I convinced myself to have my own blog to share my online as well as offline experiences. People who know me would know that this is not my first website by any chance but the first which will be updated regularly.

As you might have guessed from the tagline, this blog will be primarily centered about web development and my little experiments with my novice programming skills. Besides that I will also try to write on Apple Products and the rumors surrounding Apple Launches. The “i” in the domain name actually comes from the fact that i’m an Apple Fanboy and just love all Apple products. I will also be writing on various new Web Services and Technologies.

Only time will tell if I’ll really be able to maintain this blog and write about the stuff I’m currently thinking off. So that’s it for my first post, you can Subscribe to my RSS Feed for further updates.

P.S – Incase you haven’t already, you can have a look at my latest project created AIEEE Namewise Results 2011.
