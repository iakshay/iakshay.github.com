Itâ€™s funny how quickly you start hating your own site. 18 months back I launched first version of iakshay.net. After maybe a year, I hated it. But who has time to redo their own site? 

Finally found sometime to redo my own site. My goals were to simplify things a bit, so I gave up on WordPress and switched to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). A static site generator really popular among web developers. Using Jekyll for blog meant that I could host it on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). 

###Under the hood
*	I can write posts in markdown. Which means markup is clean and easy to manage.
*	More focus on design and content, Jekyll hardly needs any backend work. Most of the code is in HTML/CSS and Javascript. 
*	My last WordPress blog had 2000 spam comments pending approval. So now the comments are hosted on DISQUS. I have personally loved the new [DISQUS](http://disqus.com), it's lot cleaner and faster now and hopefully spam-free :).
*	I have a simple git workflow for local testing and deployment. So no more ftp editing!

I wanted to keep things simple this time, so gave up the temptation of using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) another really popular Jekyll framework with powerful plugins. Using Octopress with Github would have also made things bit more complex, since Github doesn't allow Jekyll plugins. So I would be hosting only the Jekyll generated files on Github.

I have also got rid of my previous blog posts, which hardly made sense now. Most of the hacks and tricks were outdated. I'll probably repost them in future. 

### New year, and new beginning
One of the major reasons to revamp the blog, has been to write tips, tricks and tutorials related to web development. With the exponential growth happening in Web Developement. Its becoming impossible for to me to catch up with all the new API's and frameworks. Hope this blog, motivates me to create simple experiments to learn better.

That's it for the first post on the revamped blog folks. Happy New year to all!
