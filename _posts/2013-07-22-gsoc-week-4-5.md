I spent last 2 weeks learning more about the [Infusion Renderer][0]. I created a separate [renderer branch][1] for my component on Github. Infusion renderer has a steep learning curve, the [Wiki Documentation][0] has been a very useful guide and reference to learn about the renderer.

I finally succeeded in fixing the video tile controls. I wasn't using the jQuery Event Delegation correctly. To attach event listeners to dyanmic content we need to pass 2 arguments to [.on() event][2].  
Instead of

{% highlight javascript %}
$('.selector').on('click', callbackFn);
{% endhighlight %}

I needed to do this

{% highlight javascript %}
$('.wrapper').on('.selector', 'click', callbackFn);
{% endhighlight %}

This version binds events on the _wrapper_ and so it attaches events on the new content that gets added to _wrapper_ and has class _selector_.

I also add separate template file for video controls, to keep the markup separate from JavaScript (Keeping with Infusion best practices). Next week, I plan to work on Keyboard Accesibility and ARIA Roles.
