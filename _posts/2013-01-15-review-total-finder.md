title: Review - Total Finder for OSX
---

Finally getting time to write my second blog post in 2013. And only the second one on this revamped blog. All this while had been busy working on [APOGEE 2013](http://bits-apogee.org/2013/). If you don't know anything about APOGEE. It's the techfest site for BITS, Pilani. If you are into **tech stuff** you should defintely check it out.

##The Review
Coming back to the post. This post is a review of one of my favorite apps on OSX.

Nothing is perfect. And the same implies for Apple products. I have always found the Finder on OSX annoying when it opens new windows, everytime I'm opening a directory. Resulting in 4-5 Finder windows opened at time, which is difficult to manage on a small 13" screen.

Now, Total Finder brings *Chrome like Tabs* to the Finder. That let's you handle everything in tabs inside one single window, just like Chrome.

Apart from this, another feature that I use quite often is that of *Dual Mode* which open two finder panes side by side making it easy to copy, paste and compare files in folder.

Other features include *Cut & Paste*, strangley Cut & Paste never work in existing OSX Finder. Something that's annoying for a Windows user.

That's it for my first review guys. So if you are on Mac, do checkout [Total Finder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/).
