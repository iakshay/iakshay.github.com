title: Airtel Broadband Speed Hack
---

Few months back Airtel stopped all unlimited high speed plans. And started offering all such plans with high speed upto a certain DSL bill cap, after which you would have 256kbps speed. This hack enables you to increase the speed after DSL bill cap to 512kbps.


###Simple Steps To Follow

Kudos to [Apoorv Umang](http://facebook.com/apoorvumang) for finding this hack(if it really works for you). It takes nothing more than few clicks to this. All you have to do is activate Airtel SOD and deactivate it immediately.
If you didn’t get it don’t worry. Just follow these Simple steps -

1. Open Airtel Speed on Demand after your DSL bill cap is over.
2. Select your city, and click on **Click here to proceed** in the popup that appears.
3. Now choose any plan, choose 512kbps to avoid any charges just incase.
4. Follow the screen instructions and deactivate SOD immediately.

You can now check your speed at [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net) OR just see the download speed difference (download anything!).
