Been long time since I blogged last time. If you have been following me you might know that I got selected for GSoC 2013 at IDI. This post and the series of upcoming posts are going to be about my Summer of Code Experience and Progress.

###About My Project
My project is under [Inclusive Design Institute (IDI)][0]. The project aims at creating an Accessible Cross Platform HTML5 Collaboration Web Application using [Fluid Infusion framework][6] to provide a flexible, personalizable user interface. Along with video conversation, the application shall have feature to chat, share websites and take notes collaboratively. You can find more details about my project on the the [project page][5] 

###Week 1

I spent first couple of days reading documentation about Infusion Components and going through the code of existing components. My first milestone isto create WebRTC Component for Fluid Infusion Framework. 

Since the WebRTC API forms the core of my project. I thought it would be good idea to dive into the API and understand it even if I planned to use a WebRTC library for my project.

I tried to work on a Simple Video Conferencing demo using websockets for the signalling process. The demo is still not fully cooked to to be deployed on Github. But I plan to refactor the code and upload it soon. Understanding the WebRTC API was quite challenging for me, since I haven't done any networking courses till now. Since the API is still very new there aren't many resources.
####Useful resources for understanding WebRTC
1. [Google I/O Talk 2012][1]
2. [Google I/O Talk 2013][2] ([Slides][3])
3. [Muaz Khan WebRTC Demos][4] 
   Muaz has written detailed documentation along with demos, which are really helpful to understand the signalling process.
4. [WebRTC Working Draft][7]

At the end of the week I did succeed in understanding the signalling process. I got the demo working for two users, still need to work on it to get multiple user video conference working. The WebRTC API is really exciting, the fact it connects the browsers peer-to-peer (with server being involved only for the initial signalling process) is really exciting. Its certainly going to be the next big thing on the web.
