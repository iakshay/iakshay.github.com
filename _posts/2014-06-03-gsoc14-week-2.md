This week I continued to work on [bug 989089][0] and got the PR merged into production. Had to do few iterations on this -

1. Came up jQuery UI slider solution
2. HTML5 Slider solution
3. Duration widget - 3 numeric fields
4. Changing the styling
5. Setting good defaults and step values.

About 5 iterations, and everybody is happy!

But there was a drama to this, I set the default of page expiration to 15 minutes as asked by sheppy. Which queued up lot of articles unnecessarily in production.

And it ended up in resulting [another bug][1] to reset the page expiration times of the pages that had been affected.

I also landed another PR in production, to correctly display wiki styles in CKEditor. This was a minor bug â€“ but something important for the editors allowing them to view correct formatting of the article from within the editor.

Lessons learnt for the week, I guess.
