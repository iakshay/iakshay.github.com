A Long Time Coming

It’s funny how quickly you come to hate your own site. Almost exactly 2 years ago, I launched a redesigned version of my site. After maybe a year, I hated it. But who has time to redo their own site? Apparently it took me 6 months to find the time to finish mine.

Even within those 6 months, I found things that I had started on the site that I hated. My goals were to simplify things a bit, make it responsive, and play around with Sass and Compass. I also wanted to take some of the focus off of my blog, since I really don’t write too much on it anymore (I write almost all of my articles on the Viget Blogs these days).

Forget about Wordpress or Blogger. Hacking your own stuff is much more fun. Also, make sure to read Blogging Like a Hacker, by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's cofounder and the author of Jekyll.
