Last week I started working on Keyboard Accessibility of my component. I wanted the video tiles and the control buttons (mute and fullscreen) to be accessible via keyboard. I started reading about [Fluid Keyboard Accessibility plugin][0] , the [tutorial][2] on the wiki along with [5 Stars demo][2] was quite helpful.

I finally succeded in making my plugin accessible via keyboard. This week I plan to add ARIA Roles to my plugin markup, so its accessible to screen readers. I'm also going to create a separate repository for the WebRTC Collaboration Application and try and integrate my WebRTC Component into it.
