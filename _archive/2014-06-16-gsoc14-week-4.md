This week I continued to iterate on my mozNotifier component. David, suggested we avoid hard-coding selectors. And make our component future-proof by adding a few options.

At MDN, we have switched to the new [analytics.js][0]. And we have a lof of custom events to improve the user experience. I wanted to play with analytics, so I picked on an [issue to add analytics for YouTube videos][1]. This was tricky, since we use iFrames for embedding most of our YouTube videos. I used the [YouTube iFrame API][2], to get track video events. The [PR is still in review][3] and might require some work. Right now, I am tracking the following events

1. YouTube Video load
2. Playback Quality
3. Play / Paused / Buffering / Finished state
4. And every 10% increements of video completion

I also worked on [another PR][4], to fix the wiki save buttons overlapping the form fields. The issue appeared to be only in Chrome and Safari. I plan to iterate on this and make the save buttons sticky, so that writers don't have to scroll up after making comments to wiki edit page.
