This week I didn't land any of the PR's in production.

But, I worked on 3 things this week

1. A notifier jQuery plugin for MDN, that would make it easy to show save updates on the wiki editing page.
2. Different favicons for local, staging and production servers. I added red and yellow tinted icons for local and staging environments respectively.
3. [Bug 1010022][0] â€“ To convert the unsubscribe message to sentence case, this required me to override the django template in [django-tidings][1].
