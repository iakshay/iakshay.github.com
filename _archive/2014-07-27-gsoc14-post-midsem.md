Apologies for not being able to blog more actively!

Updates from previous blog post

1. My [notifier component][0] got merged. David is now working on [improved notifications][1] sitewide. So my work might be side lined.
2. [YouTube Analytics PR][2] got merged.
3. Made the [wiki page buttons sticky][3], although they are disabled right now. Since we plan, to run Optimizely test on that.
4. I landed my [first commit on KumaScript][4], added dependency badges. Wish I could do more there.
5. Some more [UI/UX improvements][5] [here][6] and [there][7].

Apart from this I also happened to attend [MozCamp Beta India][8] in Bangalore from 20 - 22nd June. One of the best weekends, of my vacation. Met some incredible people including [habber][9], who is UX lead at Mozilla. And also helps with UI/UX work on MDN.

I also attended a Fireside Chat on Stylus by John Karalis (openjck), which was a nice experience. You can check the [slides][16] and video recordings - [part 1][10] and [part 2][11].

I also got almost a week off 14 - 18th July, while I was away for a small vacation to Singapore Family. 

This week was quite busy, [upgraded Font Awesome from 3.2 to 4.1][12] after's David's PR got reverted. More than 150 icon names got changed. Making it impossible to manually change class names in code and also in our docs.

I ended up using Stylus, to add support for legacy icon names. Will probably write another blog post about that.

Apart from this, I created pull requests for [bug 1043818][13], [bug 1008698][14] and [bug 858958][15]. All of them are 95% there, and hopefully should get them merged next week.

Oh! BTW, I passed Mid Semester evaluation :smiley: !
