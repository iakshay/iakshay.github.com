This week I finally created [repository][0] for my WebRTC component on [Github][1]. After discussion with my mentor I decided to go with the [simplewebrtc.js][2] library for video conferencing. The library also comes with [signaling server][3] using Node.js and socket.io. I plan to use the same stack for my main video conferencing application. I'll probably be forking the signaling server repository when I start working on the main collaboration application.

I decided to create view component initially, but to keep the markup separate from JavaScript. I'm going to try and convert it to renderer component next week. I'm along going to try and start with Unit Tests for my component next week. The Fluid Infusion Community uses [jqUnit][4] as a wrapper over [QUnit][5] (the testing framework used by [jQuery Project][6]).

To quote from the [docs][7]

> Fluid uses a little wrapper for QUnit called jqUnit which allows us to write tests using a jUnit style API. The main difference between the QUnit and jqUnit are the names of the test functions and the order of parameters.

So at the end of Week 2, I have the basic component working. Next week I'm going to read more about the Fluid Infusion Renderer and learn more about Unit Testing my components.
