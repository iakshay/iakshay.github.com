Hey there, I'm a 20 year old passionate web developer from New Delhi, India. I'm crazy about cutting edge web technologies, and spend most of my time playing around with them. I'm currently pursuing MSc. Mathematics and BE. Computer Science from BITS Pilani.

I love Apple products for the seamless computing experience. I find their products are perfect for me as a developer, hacker and a programmer.

I specialize in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I also have experience working with Node.js, PHP/MYSQL and Python/Django on the backend. For me future is in the browser, with API's like Web Audio API and WebGl, it's really hard to think of anything that can't be done in browsers today.
