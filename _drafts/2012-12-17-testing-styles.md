### Enable Math

1. Math rendering is disabled by default, to enable it, check on the *Enable Math* option in *Preferences* > *General* > *All Documents*:.
   
   Math support is a good addition, except that it makes the Preview blink and blink again whenever typing, as it needs to refresh the whole typesetting. That's why I make it disabled by default. I suggest only enable it when you write Math Formulas.

2. Make sure you've connected to the internet.

   The Math rendering is powered by [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org), the resources such as fonts are all online, thus the internet connection is needed for it to work.

### The Math Syntax

The syntax is the same as [Tex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX), expect one thing:

Because the characters such as \ and _ and * and so on have special meanings in Markdown language, you need to add an extra \ character before them to escape them to make the Math renders correctly.

On OS X Lion or Mountain Lion, just hit `option + command + T` in most text boxes and text areas and youâ€™ll be able to drag and drop from the character viewer.
